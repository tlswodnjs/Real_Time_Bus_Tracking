# Real_Time_Bus_Tracking_Exercise

Creates a map using the free mapbox api with the center of the map on MIT campus. 
The Javascript file then runs async functions to pull data from the MBTA api every 15 seconds. Some data include "Bus ID", "Longitute", "Latitude", etc.
Based on the location of the first bus, a marker is created and moved every 15 seconds to keep track of the bus' movement. 

## Installation

Download the Zip file on this [link](https://github.com/tlswodnjs/Real_Time_Bus_Tracking/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)to modify or make adjustments.

## Roadmap

In the future, I will update to map all 12 buses that the MBTA api provides access for. Further, I hope to include more information on the bus including bus id, how full the bus is, which direction the bus is headed and provide better estimates on when the bus might arrive given a certain location.
